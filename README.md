# WindowsExplorer-Java
A Windows Explorer by Java
This is my midterm project for my advanced programming/Java course. It mimics Windows File Explorer. It also has capabilities to synchronize two directories on Windows so that after synchronization is initiated, all changes 
in one directory are also reflected in the other (ie. file is added or deleted).
Don't forget to change all directories that I have specified in my model class so that they reflect directories on your system. For example, directories for saving settings, etc.
