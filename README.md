# WindowsExplorer-Java
A windows explorer by Java
This is a simple program that mimics windows file explorer. It also has capablities to synchronize two directories on windows so that after synchronization is initiated, all changes 
in one directory is also reflected in the other (ie. file is added or deleted).
Don't forget to change all directories which I have specified in my model class so that they reflect directories on your system. For example, directories for saving settings and etc.
